# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Python: Creating and Using Classes

# Class Definition

# Constructor (Initialization) - __init__ method

# Encapsulation: Attributes (make and model) are encapsulated within the class.


# Method - start_engine

# Encapsulation: Accessing attributes through self.


# Creating instances (objects) of the Car class

# Inheritance: Car is a class that can be used to create objects (instances).
# Abstraction: We create objects without worrying about the internal details of the Car class.

# Creating the first car (object)

# Creating the second car (object)


# Accessing object attributes

# Encapsulation: Accessing object attributes (make and model) using dot notation.


# Calling object methods

# Polymorphism: Different objects (car1 and car2) can perform the same action (start_engine).


# Method Call - start_engine
